# Walking Tours Manager
--------
I am creating this app as a sort of admin tool for the [Orlando Walking Tours](https://github.com/cforlando/orlando-walking-tours-ios) app and any derivations of it.  Originally, I had started adapting my [OWTPhotoChecklist](https://github.com/WERUreo/OWTPhotoChecklist) app to serve this purpose, but I have decided to start from scratch and create this new tool from the ground up.  Plus, this gives me a chance to flex my Objective-C muscles a little, as well as tinker with other APIS, like the Google Maps and Google Places APIs.
